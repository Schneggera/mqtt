    """Publish multiple messages to a broker, then disconnect cleanly.

    This function creates an MQTT client, connects to a broker and publishes a
    list of messages. Once the messages have been delivered, it disconnects
    cleanly from the broker.

    msgs : a list of messages to publish. Each message is either a dict or a
           tuple.

           If a dict, only the topic must be present. Default values will be
           used for any missing arguments. The dict must be of the form:

           msg = {'topic':"<topic>", 'payload':"<payload>", 'qos':<qos>,
           'retain':<retain>}
           topic must be present and may not be empty.
           If payload is "", None or not present then a zero length payload
           will be published.
           If qos is not present, the default of 0 is used.
           If retain is not present, the default of False is used.

           If a tuple, then it must be of the form:
           ("<topic>", "<payload>", qos, retain)
    hostname : a string containing the address of the broker to connect to.
               Defaults to localhost.
    port : the port to connect to the broker on. Defaults to 1883.
    client_id : the MQTT client id to use. If "" or None, the Paho library will
                generate a client id automatically.
    keepalive : the keepalive timeout value for the client. Defaults to 60
                seconds.
    will : a dict containing will parameters for the client: will = {'topic':
           "<topic>", 'payload':"<payload">, 'qos':<qos>, 'retain':<retain>}.
           Topic is required, all other parameters are optional and will
           default to None, 0 and False respectively.
           Defaults to None, which indicates no will should be used.
    auth : a dict containing authentication parameters for the client:
           auth = {'username':"<username>", 'password':"<password>"}
           Username is required, password is optional and will default to None
           if not provided.
           Defaults to None, which indicates no authentication is to be used.

          dict = {'ca_certs':"<ca_certs>", 'certfile':"<certfile>",
          'keyfile':"<keyfile>", 'tls_version':"<tls_version>",

          default to None if not provided, which results in the client using
          the default behaviour - see the paho.mqtt.client documentation.
          Defaults to None, which indicates that TLS should not be used.
    transport : set to "tcp" to use the default setting of transport which is
          raw TCP. Set to "websockets" to use WebSockets as the transport.
